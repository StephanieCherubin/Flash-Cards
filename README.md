# Flash Cards

This project is a template for flash cards website.
- This project is built in Javascript and Node based on this 
[tutorial](https://www.makeschool.com/academy/track/standalone/pete-s-pet-emporium---advanced-web-recipes/getting-started-V4Q=)
from [Make School](http://makeschool.com)
but it deviates from that tutorial.
